This is a set of routines and other things I find useful in a bunch of
programs, it is NOT a library, it is to be included in your module through some
evil CVS magic.  It builds two .a libs which are NOT installed.  You just
add it to your toplevel SUBDIRS and then link your executable against it.
Nothing from this dir is installed.

The two libs and includes are:

	libvicious.a
	libvicious-gnome.a
	vicious.h

	libviciousui.a
	libviciousui-gnome.a
	libviciousui-minimal.a
	viciousui.h

Note that libviciousui includes libvicious.  libvicious-gnome.a requires
linking against libgnome but otherwise is almost the same as libvicious,
except for using GnomeProgram for file lookup, same for the ui lib.  The
libviciousui-minimal is like libviciousui, but does not like glade-helper
and thus no glade.

Feel free to hack on this and feel free to add and modify stuff.  If you do
modify stuff please fix all the modules that include this.

Note that by including this module you are allowing people to randomly fix your
use of these routines, so if you're an anal maintainer, this is not for you.
Though you could always just cut and paste.

Make sure to have
  AC_CHECK_FUNCS([setenv unsetenv clearenv])
in your configure.in, and HAVE_SETENV, HAVE_UNSETENV and HAVE_CLEARENV in
your acconfig.h

Implementation notes:

  Namespace is "ve" except for "glade_helper" for glade helper 
  This is different for historical reasons.
