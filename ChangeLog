Sat Sep 19 15:05:42 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/mpwrap.c: optimized use of gmp vars with a copy-on-write
	  type alg, and got rid of a few temp gmp vars for common special
	  cases, this makes genius about twice as fast on my tests

Fri Sep 18 20:31:29 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/eval.c: profiling, I will need to make a copy-on-write

	* src/genius.c: fix bug to allow processing of more then one
	  expression per file

	  output function utilize file handles as well for saner use with
	  the command line

	* src/{lexer.l,parser.y}: add possibility of changing the ntoation
	  within an expression (this was just too cool not to add, but I
	  doubt it's all that usefull)

Fri Sep 18 01:22:06 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{eval.c,calc.c,structs.h,mpwrap.[ch]}: cleanups in structures

	* Restructuring, there will be 3 programs in the future,
	  gnome (the command line script like interface), gnome-genius
	  which will basically be the current one, and gnome-genius-ide
	  which will be the IDE style interface

Wed Sep 09 23:10:51 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/dict.[ch],src/structs.h: made a dictinary hash, plus made

	  likely makes no sense

Thu May 14 07:23:48 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

Sat Apr 25 21:28:38 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* genius.c: Use GnomePropertyBox. This basically involved
	reversing tmpstate and curstate in setup_calc; before we 
	saved original in tmpstate while changing curstate, now
	we change tmpstate and copy back to curstate on apply.
	Also declare tmpstate static, since it's used after the
	function returns.

	* lexer.l: generate an error on base >36 integers
	  (parse error)

	* mpwrap.c: radically faster power function for
	  float^ui, but this improves everything except

	* genius.c: couple of minor changes, Ctrl-Q now also quits

	* eval.[ch]: added if,while and ifelse construct operations, also

	  the right side. this caused trouble with separators and
	  function declarations

	* calc.c: the parse error message now says "before" instead of
	  "at" since it makes more sense

Fri Jan 09 02:08:11 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.l,dict.c: took function declaration from
	  parse time to execution time. Still segfaults all over the place

	* dict.[ch]: addfunc now returns a pointer to the actual created
	  record

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y: added a separator primitive, all it does is
	  right side. meaning you can have more expressions after each other
	  and taht will return the value of the last one

	* dict.[ch]: created dictionary contexts so that local
	  variables/functions are possible

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y,funclib.c: added user function support, not
	  yet completely finished, but it is working quite nicely already,
	  recursion does not yet work and I know what's the problem and will
	  fix it, though there are not yet any structures for programming,
	  there are many MANY small changes around these files to support this

Tue Jan 06 18:38:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

Sun Jan 04 22:59:28 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: Got the keybindings to work, so it can be completely
	  keyboard driven. ^C quits \n runs calculations.

Sun Jan 04 20:57:01 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.[ch],eval.c,genius.c: implemented calcstate structure,
	  instead of separate variables

	* genius.c: added some options for the new calcstate structure
	  these are the make results floats and scientific notation

	* calc.c: if the number of digits is reduced the number is now
	  rounded, implemented scientific notation, implemented conversion
	  to floats, some cleanup, a typo fixed

	* lexer.l: can now read integers in scientific notation as
	  floats

	* structs.h,calc.c,eval.c: changed some enum constants' names to
	  be more meaningful

	* eval.c: some cleanup, reduced the number of temporaries used in
	  some operations, put switch statements in the code instead of
	  some if/else structures

	* mymath.c: mympf_pow_ui now safely works when rop and op are one
	  and the same number (it will still not use a temp when the numbers
	  are in fact different)

Sat Jan 03 16:57:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.c, eval.c: it's possible to have functions in uncomputed
	  expressions, they will display properly

	* funclib.[ch]: deleted test_op ("test" function), added functions
	  "cos", "tan", "pi", "e"

	* mymath.[ch]: created these files for some helper gmp functions

	* eval.c: taken out mympf_pow_ui and put it into mymath.[ch]
	  added an ugly ans slow temporary way to do exponentials of
	  floats, it converts it to a rational first

Sat Jan 03 12:48:31 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.[ch]: deleted old unused functions, added prototypes
	  to genius.h, added errorreporting functions

	* dict.c: makebifunc now doesn't segfault.

	* dict.c: d_addfunc fixed, it adds dictinary entries now

	* eval.c: added NULL checking to freetree and freetree now does
	  freeargs, not freenode and makefuncd sets n->left and right to
	  NULL ... that made ugly segfaults

	* eval.c: evalnode now evaluates function args correctly

Fri Jan 02 21:21:27 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.h: removed FACTORIAL_ERROR since it's not a fatal error

	* eval.c: Should be able to run functions from funclib

	* funclib.[ch]: removed funclib_exec function since that's
	  obscolete, added addall and test_op functions and there's a
	  "test" function returns sum of three arguments (no typechecking
	  is done and they have to be integers! it's just a testroutine)

	* calc.c: added #include "funclib.h", and it will add all the
	  funclib functions the first time evalexpr is run.
