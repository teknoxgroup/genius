	* funclib.[ch]: ported to mp wrappers

	* util.c: a minor bug fixed in my_realloc

Sun Jan 11 19:00:12 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* mpwrap.c,mpwrap.h,Makefile.am: added the MP wrapper functions.

	* mymath.[ch]: ported to the new mp wrappers

	* eval.[ch],structs.h,lexer.l,parse.y: ported to the new wrappers

	* eval.c: fixed a bug in copynode

Sat Jan 10 15:41:27 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.c: "while" now works right

	* README: examples updated to work

	* eval.[ch],calc.c: took out primstr, and reimplemented a
	  better function in calc.c, this one now has the right output
	  (only spits out infix notation)

	* calc.h: added all prototypes

	* calc.c: got rid of some unused vars, added #include "dict.h"

	* eval.c: got rid of some unused vars

	* dict.[ch]: d_initcontext is now void not int

	* struct.h,dict.[ch],calc.c,eval.c,lexer.l: slight changes in naming
	  to be more consistent

	* calc.[ch],genius.c: added function to add missing parentheses
	  on the end of expression to calc, and made it do just that
	  in genius.c

	* genius.c: the entrybox is cleared after an expression is evaluated

Sat Jan 10 00:45:07 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* lexer.l,parse.y,eval.[ch]: added logical and,or,xor and not
	  operators. ! was not touched and still means factorial

	* README: updated

	* Makefile.am: using YACCFLAGS for arguments instead fo YACC

	* eval.c,calc.c: messed with the expression printing to at
	  least print something debuggable before making it right

	* eval.c: secondright is now copied, this fixes ifelse

	* lexer.l: fixed a bug in argument references during parse

	* eval.c: while doesn't check for a number (it does it's
	  own evaluation), but it still seems broken

Fri Jan 09 21:05:18 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: couple of minor changes, Ctrl-Q now also quits

	* eval.[ch]: added if,while and ifelse construct operations, also
	  reversed how branches returns the argument (it was wrong) and
	  made a function for telling which ones should get evaluated during
	  calculations (evalnode)

	* structs.h, eval.[ch]: added a secondright argument to primitives
	  since ifelse needs it

	* parse.y: added the parsing info for while,if,ifelse. lexer already
	  included it

	* eval.c: split up evalnode to several functions

	* README: updated

	* eval.h: took out an obscolete prototype

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.l: added comparison operators,
	  ==,!=,<=>,>,<,>=,<=

	* genius.c: ! taken out of the numpad, % put in

Fri Jan 09 16:17:38 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.c: fixed another bug in copynode, this fixes some segfaults,
	  and makes global functions work, local ones still segfault

	* eval.c: fixed a bug in evaluation, first evaluate left THEN
	  the right side. this caused trouble with separators and
	  function declarations

	* calc.c: the parse error message now says "before" instead of
	  "at" since it makes more sense

Fri Jan 09 02:08:11 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.l,dict.c: took function declaration from
	  parse time to execution time. Still segfaults all over the place

	* eval.c: fixed copynode, added function for adding fake function
	  nodes for declarations

Thu Jan 08 00:11:22 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* README: updated to reflect the changes

	* COPYING: added

	* genius.c: make floats ints is now disabled by default as
	  it is not too intuitive, meaning it might not do what a user
	  expects

Wed Jan 07 23:44:13 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* dict.[ch]: addfunc now returns a pointer to the actual created
	  record

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y: added a separator primitive, all it does is
	  right side. meaning you can have more expressions after each other
	  and taht will return the value of the last one

	* dict.[ch]: created dictionary contexts so that local
	  variables/functions are possible

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y,funclib.c: added user function support, not
	  yet completely finished, but it is working quite nicely already,
	  recursion does not yet work and I know what's the problem and will
	  fix it, though there are not yet any structures for programming,
	  there are many MANY small changes around these files to support this

Tue Jan 06 18:38:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch],parse.y: added mod ('%') operator

Tue Jan 06 15:38:49 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: Make use of the app widget, get rid of buttons in favor of
	  menus, use gnome_init instead of gtk_init, add #include <gnome.h>

Mon Jan 05 23:14:56 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.c,calc.c,structs.h: changed some tree_t internals to
	  match the new constant names

	* eval.c,struct.c: it should be now possible to evaluate user
	  which are just compiled into evaluation trees

	* util.[ch]: took out makelc

	* dict.[ch]: made searches case sensitive and added support for
	  user functions

	* lexer.l,parser.y: added support for no-argument user functions
	  (variables) setting

	* calc.c: fixed a bug so that the builtin functions don't get
	  added again and again

	* eval.[ch]: added the '=' operation and changed evalexp to be able
	  to set variables

Sun Jan 04 23:50:25 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: accelerator stuff revamped, and all is done through
	  the keypress event, nothing will happen on empty string

Sun Jan 04 22:59:28 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: Got the keybindings to work, so it can be completely
	  keyboard driven. ^C quits \n runs calculations.

Sun Jan 04 20:57:01 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.[ch],eval.c,genius.c: implemented calcstate structure,
	  instead of separate variables

	* genius.c: added some options for the new calcstate structure
	  these are the make results floats and scientific notation

	* calc.c: if the number of digits is reduced the number is now
	  rounded, implemented scientific notation, implemented conversion
	  to floats, some cleanup, a typo fixed

	* lexer.l: can now read integers in scientific notation as
	  floats

	* structs.h,calc.c,eval.c: changed some enum constants' names to
	  be more meaningful

	* dict.c: small typo to make builtin functions

	* eval.c: some cleanup, reduced the number of temporaries used in
	  some operations, put switch statements in the code instead of
	  some if/else structures

	* mymath.c: mympf_pow_ui now safely works when rop and op are one
	  and the same number (it will still not use a temp when the numbers
	  are in fact different)

Sat Jan 03 16:57:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.c, eval.c: it's possible to have functions in uncomputed
	  expressions, they will display properly

	* funclib.[ch]: deleted test_op ("test" function), added functions
	  "cos", "tan", "pi", "e"

	* mymath.[ch]: created these files for some helper gmp functions

	* eval.c: taken out mympf_pow_ui and put it into mymath.[ch]
	  added an ugly ans slow temporary way to do exponentials of
	  floats, it converts it to a rational first

Sat Jan 03 12:48:31 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.[ch]: deleted old unused functions, added prototypes
	  to genius.h, added errorreporting functions

	* calc.c, eval.c: now use the error reporting function

Sat Jan 03 02:18:55 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch], calc.c, parse.y: the stack is now a structure of type
	  evalstack_t, it's a dynamic array now

	* eval.c: added #include "util.h"

	* util.c: made my_realloc safer

	* funclib.c: added #include <gmp.h>

	* funclib.[ch]: sine function added ("sin"), works only for -pi<x<pi

Sat Jan 03 00:37:52 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* util.c: proper casting in makelc

	* dict.c: makebifunc now doesn't segfault.

	* dict.c: d_addfunc fixed, it adds dictinary entries now

	* eval.c: added NULL checking to freetree and freetree now does
	  freeargs, not freenode and makefuncd sets n->left and right to
	  NULL ... that made ugly segfaults

	* eval.c: evalnode now evaluates function args correctly

Fri Jan 02 21:21:27 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.h: removed FACTORIAL_ERROR since it's not a fatal error

	* eval.c: Should be able to run functions from funclib

	* funclib.[ch]: removed funclib_exec function since that's
	  obscolete, added addall and test_op functions and there's a
	  "test" function returns sum of three arguments (no typechecking
	  is done and they have to be integers! it's just a testroutine)

	* calc.c: added #include "funclib.h", and it will add all the
	  funclib functions the first time evalexpr is run.
