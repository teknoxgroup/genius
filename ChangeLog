	* src/parse.y: took out the old way (bc) of writing function as we
	  will need the "{}" for sets, added some set rules, but no
	  functionality

	* src/strucs.h,src/*.c: changed ETree to be a union of structs to
	  do the polymorphism in a nicer manner and to allow more future
	  extention, this requires some changes to any code using ETree's
	  (if anybody has done anything lik that)

	* src/*.c: fixed miscellaneous bugs

	* configure.in: raised version

1999-05-18 03:27 1999  Tomas Ögren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* src/plugread*.[ch]: new routine that has a gnome and a dumb
	  non-gnome implementation so it's separated into two files

	* src/calc.[ch]: add ability to read a list of .plugin files
	  (no plugin functionality yet!)

	* src/{genius.c,gnome-genius.c,Makefile.am}: move lib.cgel into
	  a /gel/ subdirectory when installed and add a plugins directory
	  as well to add .plugin files into

	* src/test.plugin: just a simple test file

Wed May 12 01:34:04 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/{calc.[ch],inter.[ch],genius.c,gnome-genius.c}: instead of

	  it is separated from the rest of the code. It contains a HACK
	  however to figure out the bounds of a single expression in the
	  same way that the lexer/parser do. This is of course not
	  possible without a parser, but it should be ok for normal use
	  and only differs in functionality in cases of errors (or should)

	* src/{genius.c,gnome-genius.c,calc.c,lexer.l}: get rid of readline

	  interrupt of calculations

1999-05-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: Check for termcap, then use -ltermcap in the
	readline check only if termcap was found (some readlines don't 
	require -ltermcap apparently)

Mon May 03 00:46:15 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

Thu Jan 29 02:07:37 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* util.[ch],calc.c,eval.[ch]: using GList for stacks now

	  least print something debuggable before making it right

	* genius.c: couple of minor changes, Ctrl-Q now also quits

	* eval.[ch]: added if,while and ifelse construct operations, also

	  calculations (evalnode)

	* structs.h, eval.[ch]: added a secondright argument to primitives
	  since ifelse needs it

	* dict.[ch]: addfunc now returns a pointer to the actual created
	  record

	  and taht will return the value of the last one

	* dict.[ch]: created dictionary contexts so that local
	  variables/functions are possible

	* eval.[ch],parse.y,lexer.y,funclib.c: added user function support, not
	  yet completely finished, but it is working quite nicely already,
	  recursion does not yet work and I know what's the problem and will
	  fix it, though there are not yet any structures for programming,
	  there are many MANY small changes around these files to support this

Tue Jan 06 18:38:17 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	  to set variables

Sun Jan 04 23:50:25 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: accelerator stuff revamped, and all is done through

Sun Jan 04 22:59:28 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.c: Got the keybindings to work, so it can be completely
	  keyboard driven. ^C quits \n runs calculations.

Sun Jan 04 20:57:01 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.[ch],eval.c,genius.c: implemented calcstate structure,
	  instead of separate variables

	* genius.c: added some options for the new calcstate structure

	  to floats, some cleanup, a typo fixed

	* lexer.l: can now read integers in scientific notation as
	  floats

	* structs.h,calc.c,eval.c: changed some enum constants' names to
	  be more meaningful

	* dict.c: small typo to make builtin functions

	* eval.c: some cleanup, reduced the number of temporaries used in
	  some operations, put switch statements in the code instead of
	  some if/else structures

	* mymath.c: mympf_pow_ui now safely works when rop and op are one
	  and the same number (it will still not use a temp when the numbers
	  are in fact different)

	* calc.c, eval.c: it's possible to have functions in uncomputed
	  expressions, they will display properly

	* funclib.[ch]: deleted test_op ("test" function), added functions
	  "cos", "tan", "pi", "e"

	* mymath.[ch]: created these files for some helper gmp functions

	* eval.c: taken out mympf_pow_ui and put it into mymath.[ch]
	  added an ugly ans slow temporary way to do exponentials of
	  floats, it converts it to a rational first

Sat Jan 03 12:48:31 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* genius.[ch]: deleted old unused functions, added prototypes
	  to genius.h, added errorreporting functions

	* calc.c, eval.c: now use the error reporting function

Sat Jan 03 02:18:55 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* eval.[ch], calc.c, parse.y: the stack is now a structure of type
	  evalstack_t, it's a dynamic array now

	* eval.c: added #include "util.h"

	* util.c: made my_realloc safer

	* funclib.c: added #include <gmp.h>

	* funclib.[ch]: sine function added ("sin"), works only for -pi<x<pi

Sat Jan 03 00:37:52 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* util.c: proper casting in makelc

	* dict.c: makebifunc now doesn't segfault.

	* dict.c: d_addfunc fixed, it adds dictinary entries now

	* eval.c: added NULL checking to freetree and freetree now does
	  freeargs, not freenode and makefuncd sets n->left and right to
	  NULL ... that made ugly segfaults

	* eval.c: evalnode now evaluates function args correctly

Fri Jan 02 21:21:27 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* calc.h: removed FACTORIAL_ERROR since it's not a fatal error

	* eval.c: Should be able to run functions from funclib

	* funclib.[ch]: removed funclib_exec function since that's
	  obscolete, added addall and test_op functions and there's a
	  "test" function returns sum of three arguments (no typechecking
	  is done and they have to be integers! it's just a testroutine)

	* calc.c: added #include "funclib.h", and it will add all the
	  funclib functions the first time evalexpr is run.
