New in 0.2.1:
	* about twice as much execution speed, it is now almost as fast as
	  bc, execution wise ... but since it uses GMP it will be much faster
	  when working with large numbers
	* reads two files on startup <prefix>/share/genius/lib.gel and
	  ~/.gnomeinit
	* a whole bunch of new functions (floor,ceil,sum,prod,trunc,min,max,
	  gcd)
	* and of course bugfixes
